# Workflow Foundation

Here are some key namespaces in Workflow Foundation (WF):

1. **System.Activities**: This namespace contains the core types and classes for building workflows. It provides activities, base classes, and other infrastructure components necessary for creating workflows.

2. **System.Activities.Expressions**: This namespace includes classes for working with expressions within workflows. Expressions are used to define dynamic values and calculations within workflow activities.

3. **System.Activities.Statements**: This namespace contains a variety of statement activities that can be used within workflows. Statement activities typically represent executable actions within the workflow.

4. **System.Activities.Tracking**: This namespace is used for tracking and monitoring the execution of workflows. It provides classes for configuring and managing tracking data.

5. **System.Activities.XamlIntegration**: This namespace contains classes for working with XAML (eXtensible Application Markup Language) representations of workflows. XAML is often used to define workflows visually.

6. **System.ServiceModel.Activities**: This namespace provides activities specifically designed for building Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) services as part of workflows.

7. **System.Activities.DurableInstancing**: This namespace contains classes for working with durable instancing, which allows workflows to persist their state and resume from where they left off after being persisted.

8. **System.Activities.DynamicUpdate**: This namespace provides support for updating workflows dynamically without requiring the entire workflow definition to be recompiled or redeployed.
